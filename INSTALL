This is dnsperf, a collection of DNS server performance testing tools.
For more information, see the dnsperf(1) and resperf(1) man pages.

NOTE 1: The build has been updated in this branch and so the build instructions
are different to those for the master branch.

NOTE 2: The build requires autoconf-archive (package autoconf-archive on Debian)

NOTE 3: On platforms such as MacOS which do not installed openssl in
the default directories, you will need to use the '--with-openssl'
option to configure, e.g. 'configure --with-openssl=/usr/local/opt/openssl'

To configure, compile, and install these programs, follow these steps.

1. Make sure that BIND 9 (9.4.0 or greater) is installed, including libraries
   and header files, and that the isc-config.sh program distributed with BIND
   is in your path.
   
   Note: many versions of bind do not correctly install the <isc/hmacsha.h>
   header file, so if the compilation fails, obtain this file from the BIND
   source distribution, and install it in the appropriate place.

2. Run "autoreconf -fi" and "./configure" to configure the software.  Most
   standard configure options are supported. If you get an error
   'possibly undefined macro: AC_MSG_ERROR' ensure that autoconf-archive
   is installed.

3. Run "make" to build dnsperf and resperf

4. Run "make install" to install dnsperf and resperf.

Additional software is available in the contrib/ directory.
